class Rack::Attack

  ### Configure Cache ###

  # If you don't want to use Rails.cache (Rack::Attack's default), then
  # configure it here.
  #
  # Note: The store is only used for throttling (not blocklisting and
  # safelisting). It must implement .increment and .write like
  # ActiveSupport::Cache::Store

  # Rack::Attack.cache.store = ActiveSupport::Cache::MemoryStore.new

  ### Throttle Spammy Clients ###

  # If any single client IP is making tons of requests, then they're
  # probably malicious or a poorly-configured scraper. Either way, they
  # don't deserve to hog all of the app server's CPU. Cut them off!
  #
  # Note: If you're serving assets through rack, those requests may be
  # counted by rack-attack and this throttle may be activated too
  # quickly. If so, enable the condition to exclude them from tracking.

  # Throttle all requests by IP (60rpm)
  #
  # Key: "rack::attack:#{Time.now.to_i/:period}:req/ip:#{req.ip}"
  throttle('req/user_agent', limit: 10, period: 5.minutes) do |req|
    req.user_agent if req.user_agent.present? && req.user_agent.match(/OAI-SearchBot/i)
    req.user_agent if req.user_agent.present? && req.user_agent.match(/bingbot/i)
    req.user_agent if req.user_agent.present? && req.user_agent.match(/meta-externalagent/i)
    req.user_agent if req.user_agent.present? && req.user_agent.match(/Barkrowler/i)
    req.user_agent if req.user_agent.present? && req.user_agent.match(/BLEXBot/i)
  end

  throttle('req/ip', limit: 100, period: 1.minutes) do |req|
    req.ip
  end

  ### Prevent Brute-Force Login Attacks ###

  # The most common brute-force login attack is a brute-force password
  # attack where an attacker simply tries a large number of emails and
  # passwords to see if any credentials match.
  #
  # Another common method of attack is to use a swarm of computers with
  # different IPs to try brute-forcing a password for a specific account.

  # Throttle POST requests to /login by IP address
  #
  # Key: "rack::attack:#{Time.now.to_i/:period}:logins/ip:#{req.ip}"
  throttle('logins/ip', limit: 5, period: 20.seconds) do |req|
    if req.path == '/login' && req.post?
      req.ip
    end
  end

  # Throttle POST requests to /login by email param
  #
  # Key: "rack::attack:#{Time.now.to_i/:period}:logins/email:#{normalized_email}"
  #
  # Note: This creates a problem where a malicious user could intentionally
  # throttle logins for another user and force their login requests to be
  # denied, but that's not very common and shouldn't happen to you. (Knock
  # on wood!)
  throttle('logins/email', limit: 5, period: 20.seconds) do |req|
    if req.path == '/login' && req.post?
      # Normalize the email, using the same logic as your authentication process, to
      # protect against rate limit bypasses. Return the normalized email if present, nil otherwise.
      req.params['email'].to_s.downcase.gsub(/\s+/, "").presence
    end
  end

  blocklist('block all access to deprecated paths') do |request|
    # Requests are blocked if the return value is truthy
    request.path.start_with?("/de/topics")
    request.path.start_with?("/en/topics")
  end

  ### Custom Throttle Response ###

  # By default, Rack::Attack returns an HTTP 429 for throttled responses,
  # which is just fine.
  #
  # If you want to return 503 so that the attacker might be fooled into
  # believing that they've successfully broken your app (or you just want to
  # customize the response), then uncomment these lines.
  # self.throttled_response = lambda do |env|
  #  [ 503,  # status
  #    {},   # headers
  #    ['']] # body
  # end
# # Fallback to memory if we don't have Redis present or we're in test mode
  if !ENV['REDIS_URL'] || Rails.env.test?
    Rack::Attack.cache.store = ActiveSupport::Cache::MemoryStore.new
  end
