      title: "About Speakerinnen*"
      text: "Many people are saddened by the fact that conferences and media invite more men than women.
            There is no explanation for this in Biology: men are not smarter than women.<br>
            Pointing out this discrepancy to organisers is often ill-received.
            They simply couldn't find women suitable for the job. We're convinced that there are more competent women, in addition to the ones who already courageously took the stage.<br>
            Girls need female role-models and women need the confirmation that the opinion of others - theirs - on a certain topic, is just as valued. Events need more diversity.<br><br>
            The Speakerinnen List sprung from the idea of many women,
            and is built technically as a study project by Rails Girls Berlin.
            Rails Girls is an international not-for-profit organization,
            that aims to get women excited about programming. With workshops, study groups and scholarships, Rails Girls is an extraordinary study community.<br>
            <small>* Talking about woman* we mean everybody who defines herself as a woman.</small>"
