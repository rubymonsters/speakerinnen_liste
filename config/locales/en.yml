        about: 'We want a balanced speaker ratio on the conferences we go to. <br>
                Most conferences in tech, marketing, digital media but also in other areas unfortunately have mostly male speakers,
                moderators or coaches (see <a href="http://50prozent.noblogs.org">here</a> some examples).<br>
                We want to change that ratio and help event organisers to find female speakers for their conferences.
                And female speakers, moderators or coaches to be more visible on the web.'
