      about:  |
        We want a balanced speaker ratio on the conferences we go to. Most conferences in tech, marketing, digital media but also in other areas unfortunately have mostly male speakers, moderators or coaches (see <a href="http://50prozent.noblogs.org">here</a> some examples). We want to change that ratio and help event organisers to find female speakers for their conferences. And female speakers, moderators or coaches to be more visible on the web.
