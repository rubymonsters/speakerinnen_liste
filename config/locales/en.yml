                Possibly, nobody has created a tag for this topic yet. As soon as a speaker names this topic as one of her tags, this topic becomes visible as a tag within the topic range.<br>

      objective:
        title: "Objective"
        intro: |
          People are often frustrated by the fact that it's usually men who are interviewed by
          the media or asked to present at conferences and not women. There isn't a
          biological explanation for this. Men are not cleverer than women. Anyone who points
           out this discrepancy is usually told that there wasn't a suitable woman available.
           We are convinced  that there are a lot more competent women around than just those who
           speak in public. Girls need female role models, women need the assurance that another
           view on the topic, ie theirs, is equally relevant. Events need more diversity.
        text: |
          The main aim of the Speakerinnen-List to increase the visibility of women in
          the field of public speaking. With the help of our list it will be easier for
          organisers to find female experts to speak at their events. We also want to
          actively invite women* to speak more often and in public about their area of expertise.

        intro: |
          The Speakerinnen-List was created by 8 women with the support of 4
          coaches as part of Rails Girls Berlin learning project.

            <a href="http://www.railsgirlsberlin.de" target="_blank">Rails Girls</a> is an
            international non-profit organisation that motivates women to learn computer
            programming. They facilitate this through interesting workshops, study groups,
            grants and by creating a positive  learning community. The
            <a href="http://twitter.com/rubymonsters" target="_blank">Rubymonsters</a>
            are a study group which emerged during one of the Rails Girls Berlin workshops.
          history: |
            The idea of having a database of female speakers originated during numerous
            discussions both online and offline about the dominance of men in the public domain.
            There are lots of reasons for this and the Speakerinnen-List isn't a solution for
            all of them. But it is a step towards making it easier for organisers to achieve a
            balanced male to female ratio at their events.
          motivation: |
            In addition we want to support women* in finding the right platform. We hope they
            will be encouraged by the experiences of other women and see that they too have a
            contribution to  make.

    faq:
      title: "FAQ"
      question1: "Why is there no speaker for the topic I am looking for?"
      answer1: "Possibly, nobody has created a tag for this topic yet. As soon as a speaker names this topic as one of her tags, this topic becomes visible as a tag within the topic range."
      question2: "Can anybody join in?"
      answer2: "Yes."
      question3: "Why has my profile not been activated yet?"
      answer3: "One of two reasons may apply. If your profile has just been created, it might take a bit since we're not online 24/7. We might have thought that your profile is a draft version because we might have had the impression that there is too little information so far. In case you mean to have it activtated as is, please drop us a line: speakerinnen@lists.riseup.net"
      question4: "How do I use the search function?"
      answer4: "You can search the fields, the speakers filled in their profiles: name - language - city - references - topics - biography - title. You can search for combinations with AND an OR, e.g. energy berlin. If you use multiple words together they will be used as AND operator by default. "
      question5: "How can I donate any money?"
      answer5: "Thank you for such a nice and cooperative idea. A donations button will be projected in due course."
