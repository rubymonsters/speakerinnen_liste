        faq_short: |
                <strong>Why is there no speaker for the topic I am looking for?</strong><br>
                Possibly, nobody has created a tag for this topic yet. As soon as a speaker names this topic as one of her tags, this topic becomes visible as a tag within the topic range.<br>
                <br><strong>Can anybody join in?</strong><br>
                Yes.
