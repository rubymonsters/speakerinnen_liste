== Description

This library allows for the identification of a file's likely MIME content
type. This is release 1.19 with new MIME types. The identification of MIME
content type is based on a file's filename extensions.

MIME::Types for Ruby was originally based on and synchronized with MIME::Types
for Perl by Mark Overmeer, copyright 2001 - 2009. As of version 1.15, the data
format for the MIME::Type list has changed and the synchronization will no
longer happen.
