    # Updates all records with details given if they match a set of conditions supplied, limits and order can

    # or validations.
    #
    # ==== Parameters
    #
    # * +updates+ - A string, array, or hash representing the SET part of an SQL statement.
    # * +conditions+ - A string, array, or hash representing the WHERE part of an SQL statement.
    #   See conditions in the intro.
    # * +options+ - Additional options are <tt>:limit</tt> and <tt>:order</tt>, see the examples for usage.
    #
    # ==== Examples
    #
    #   # Update all customers with the given attributes
    #   Customer.update_all :wants_email => true
    #
    #   # Update all books with 'Rails' in their title

    #   # Update all avatars migrated more than a week ago

    #   # Update all books that match conditions, but limit it to 5 ordered by date
    #   Book.update_all "author = 'David'", "title LIKE '%Rails%'", :order => 'created_at', :limit => 5
    #
    #   # Conditions from the current relation also works

    # ==== Parameters
    #
    # * +id+ - This should be the id or an array of ids to be updated.
    # * +attributes+ - This should be a hash of attributes or an array of hashes.
    #
    # ==== Examples
    #
    #   # Updates one record
    #   Person.update(15, :user_name => 'Samuel', :group => 'expert')
    #
    #   # Updates multiple records
    #   people = { 1 => { "first_name" => "David" }, 2 => { "first_name" => "Jeremy" } }
    #   Person.update(people.keys, people.values)

    # Destroys the records matching +conditions+ by instantiating each
    # record and calling its +destroy+ method. Each object's callbacks are
    # executed (including <tt>:dependent</tt> association options and
    # +before_destroy+/+after_destroy+ Observer methods). Returns the
    # collection of objects that were destroyed; each will be frozen, to
    # reflect that no changes should be made (since they can't be
    # persisted).
    #
    # Note: Instantiation, callback execution, and deletion of each
    # record can be time consuming when you're removing many records at
    # once. It generates at least one SQL +DELETE+ query per record (or
    # possibly more, to enforce your callbacks). If you want to delete many
    # rows quickly, without concern for their associations or callbacks, use
    # +delete_all+ instead.
    #
    # ==== Parameters
    #
    # * +conditions+ - A string, array, or hash that specifies which records
    #   to destroy. If omitted, all records are destroyed. See the
    #   Conditions section in the introduction to ActiveRecord::Base for
    #   more information.
    #
    # ==== Examples
    #
    #   Person.destroy_all("last_login < '2004-04-04'")
    #   Person.destroy_all(:status => "inactive")
    #   Person.where(:age => 0..18).destroy_all

        where(conditions).destroy_all
      else
        to_a.each {|object| object.destroy }.tap { reset }
      end
    end

    # Destroy an object (or multiple objects) that has the given id, the object is instantiated first,
    # therefore all callbacks and filters are fired off before the object is deleted. This method is
    # less efficient than ActiveRecord#delete but allows cleanup methods and other actions to be run.
    #
    # This essentially finds the object (or multiple objects) with the given id, creates a new object
    # from the attributes, and then calls destroy on it.
    #
    # ==== Parameters
    #
    # * +id+ - Can be either an Integer or an Array of Integers.
    #
    # ==== Examples
    #
    #   # Destroy a single object
    #   Todo.destroy(1)
    #
    #   # Destroy multiple objects
    #   todos = [1,2,3]
    #   Todo.destroy(todos)
    def destroy(id)
      if id.is_a?(Array)
        id.map { |one_id| destroy(one_id) }
      else
        find(id).destroy
      end
    end

    # Deletes the records matching +conditions+ without instantiating the records first, and hence not
    # calling the +destroy+ method nor invoking callbacks. This is a single SQL DELETE statement that
    # goes straight to the database, much more efficient than +destroy_all+. Be careful with relations
    # though, in particular <tt>:dependent</tt> rules defined on associations are not honored. Returns
    # the number of rows affected.
    #
    # ==== Parameters
    #
    # * +conditions+ - Conditions are specified the same way as with +find+ method.
    #
    # ==== Example
    #
    #   Post.delete_all("person_id = 5 AND (category = 'Something' OR category = 'Else')")
    #   Post.delete_all(["person_id = ? AND (category = ? OR category = ?)", 5, 'Something', 'Else'])
    #   Post.where(:person_id => 5).where(:category => ['Something', 'Else']).delete_all
    #
    # Both calls delete the affected posts all at once with a single DELETE statement.
    # If you need to destroy dependent associations or call your <tt>before_*</tt> or
    # +after_destroy+ callbacks, use the +destroy_all+ method instead.

    # Record objects are not instantiated, so the object's callbacks are not
    # executed, including any <tt>:dependent</tt> association options or
    # Observer methods.
    #
    # You can delete multiple rows at once by passing an Array of <tt>id</tt>s.
    #
    # Note: Although it is often much faster than the alternative,
    # <tt>#destroy</tt>, skipping callbacks might bypass business logic in
    # your application that ensures referential integrity or performs other
    # essential jobs.
