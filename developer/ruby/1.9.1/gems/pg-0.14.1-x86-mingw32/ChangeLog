	[PATCH] Recognize PGRES_SINGLE_TUPLE as OK when checking PGresult

	From 10cdc23ac4e3cfc91488f3f8a7a44f3275c9fe0a Mon Sep 17 00:00:00
	2001 This is used for the new single row mode introduced in

	* History.rdoc, ext/pg_connection.c, lib/pg.rb:

	[a3a3177b921c]

	* .hoerc, ext/pg.h, ext/pg_connection.c, ext/pg_result.c,
	spec/pg/result_spec.rb:
	New method: PG::Result#check. (fixes #123)

	This method exposes a previously internal-only function for checking
	the status of a PG::Result, primarily for people using the async
	interface. The check is done for you if you're using the synchronous
	interface, but there was no way to get the same behavior for results
	fetched via PG::Connection#get_result.

	This change also adds the PG::Connection associated with a result as
	an instance variable (@connection) on the PG::Result object.

	Thanks to @royaltm for the idea.
	[237cc4f69f63]

	* ext/pg_connection.c, spec/pg/connection_spec.rb:
	New method: PG::Connection#set_default_encoding (fixes #124)

	This pulls up the code that sets the client_encoding in synchronous
	connections into a public method that can be called by people using
	the asynchronous API to achieve the same thing once the connection
	is established.

	Thanks to @royaltm for the suggestion.

	* sample/disk_usage_report.rb, sample/minimal-testcase.rb,
	sample/pg_statistics.rb, sample/replication_monitor.rb,
	sample/wal_shipper.rb, sample/warehouse_partitions.rb:
	Add a pile of additional sample scripts that perform various
	administrative tasks.

	These have all been fairly well battle-tested and are in production
	use at $DAYJOB, though they were cleaned up for addition to the
	Ruby-PG repo.

	See the top comments in each script for additional information, or
	the
	--help flag on any of them for usage.

	 - disk_usage_report

	 Quick reporting on the heaviest disk consumers for a
	database. Nice for cronned/email reporting.

	 - pg_statistics

	 Continuous polled statistics for a database.
	Suitable for graphing with gnuplot (example
	included.)

	 - replication_monitor

	 A command-line monitor for slave replication lag.
	Works for both streaming replication and WAL
	shipping. You should be able to use it as a base to
	plug into your preferred monitoring system.

	 - wal_shipper

	 A smart WAL file transfer script, similar to
	PITRTools.

	 - warehouse_partitions

	 An automated tablespace migrator for older, date-
	based partitioned tables.

2012-03-09  Michael Granger  <ged@FaerieMUD.org>

	* ext/pg_result.c:
	Avoid use of uninitialized Arrays (fixes #47).

	Instead of declaring an Array at the beginning of fetching results
	and pushing values onto it to return at the end (which could result
	in a segfault if the GC runs during a NEWOBJ.

	* Removed the type OID constants from PGresult; I was including them
	so they could be used for comparison with PGresult#ftype return
	values. RhodiumToad on #postgresql@freenode showed me the
	format_type() SQL function, so I added an example of how to get
	the same information via that function instead, which is
	guaranteed to be correct even if src/include/catalog/pg_type.h
	changes.

	* .irbrc, COPYING.txt, ChangeLog, MANIFEST, README, README.OS_X,

	Updated build system
	* Backed out the experimental arch-specific subdir of lib
	* Removed second copy of GPL; one is more than enough.
	* Removed the ChangeLog -- this should be built on demand instead of
	checked in.
	* Removed the out-of-date and now-superfluous MANIFEST
	* Started updating the remaining documentation to reflect the current
	state of the library/build instructions/people.
	* Pass options to 'rake' through to extconf.rb, allowing 'rake --
	--with-pg-dir=/path/to/pg'
	* Updated the handling of compilation on MacOS X to use the
	architectures common to both libpq and Ruby.
	* Use an extconf.h for configuration
	* Removed the now-unused ext_helper.rb

	Still more work to be done, but I'm checkpointing this so it's not
	too huge.

	 * Factored out the database setup and teardown functions into helpers,
	added a collection of other helper functions for specs.
	 * Added specs to cover behavior around Nikolai Lugovoi's patch

	applying it.

	 Fix PGconn#async_exec and PGconn#get_last_result to properly clear

	 Also, change PGconn#get_result to not raise an exception

	   * added PGconn.connect_start(...) -> PGconn
	   * added test for PGconn.connect_start()
	   * refactored to separate the complexity of parsing the connection

	   * Removed some superfluous code for old versions of Ruby that
	don't support rb_define_alloc_func(). Those versions of Ruby
	most likely don't work anyway, and I'm not testing them.

	 Changed all temporary allocations to use ALLOC_N (heap
	allocation) rather than ALLOCA_N (stack allocation). In
	particular, this allows PGconn#escape_string to accept larger
	input strings without fear of exceeding the stack size.

	This should resolve the problem of building on OS X.
	 * A couple comment fixes.

	   * removed extra CFLAGS because they were causing portability problems.
	[449d54289f07]

2008-01-17  Jeff Davis  <davis.jeffrey@gmail.com>

	* tests/pg_spec.rb, tests/tc_postgres.rb:

	[4f276bb9c4b1]

2008-01-08  Jeff Davis  <davis.jeffrey@gmail.com>

	* ext/pg.c:
	Added:
	  * conn.set_client_encoding
	  * conn.get_client_encoding

	 get_client_encoding returns a string, and the PQclientEncoding
	function returns an encoding ID, which is why I didn't use the name
	client_encoding. That leaves room later to add a wrapper for the
	libpq PQclientEncoding if there is a need, without a name conflict.
	[1fd8b2aaac4c]

	* ext/pg.c:
	Added:
	 * conn.make_empty_pgresult(status)

	use PQexecParams if optional parameters are passed.

	Change conn.send_query to use PQsendQuery if no parameters are
	passed, and use PQsendQueryParams if optional parameters are
	passed.

	Split 'ruby-pg' module and 'postgres' module into separate parts of
	the repository. They will be maintained separately, and be released
	as separate gems from this point forward.

	One reason for this change is because we need separate gems. If we
	distribute both modules as one gem, the documentation is not
	properly generated due to class name conflicts.

	Another reason is to reduce confusion between the two modules.

	Also, I don't plan on making many improvements (aside from bugfixes
	and portability issues) to the old 'postgres' code. I'd like to get
	it to a stable state, and leave it alone. Meanwhile, the 'pg' module
	can be developed on a faster timeline.

	Split 'ruby-pg' module and 'postgres' module into separate parts of
	the repository. They will be maintained separately, and be released
	as separate gems from this point forward.

	One reason for this change is because we need separate gems. If we
	distribute both modules as one gem, the documentation is not
	properly generated due to class name conflicts.

	Another reason is to reduce confusion between the two modules.

	Also, I don't plan on making many improvements (aside from bugfixes
	and portability issues) to the old 'postgres' code. I'd like to get
	it to a stable state, and leave it alone. Meanwhile, the 'pg' module
	can be developed on a faster timeline.
