API changes to RDoc

* Remove global state
* Remove RDoc::RDocError
* RDoc::TopLevel#add_method should automatically create the appropriate method
  class rather than requiring one be passed in.
* Remove #comment= from Context subclasses in favor of #add_comment
* RDoc::CodeObject
  * Move into own namespace
  * Rename TopLevel to File
  * Rename Context to Container
  * Rename NormalClass to Class

=== Crazy Ideas

  * Auto-normalize heading levels to look OK.  It's weird to see an <h1> in
    the middle of a method section.
