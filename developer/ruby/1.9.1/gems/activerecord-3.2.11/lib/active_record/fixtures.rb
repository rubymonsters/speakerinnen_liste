  # \Fixtures are a way of organizing data that you want to test against; in short, sample data.
  #
  # They are stored in YAML files, one file per model, which are placed in the directory
  # appointed by <tt>ActiveSupport::TestCase.fixture_path=(path)</tt> (this is automatically
  # configured for Rails, so you can just put your files in <tt><your-rails-app>/test/fixtures/</tt>).
  # The fixture file ends with the <tt>.yml</tt> file extension (Rails example:
  # <tt><your-rails-app>/test/fixtures/web_sites.yml</tt>). The format of a fixture file looks
  # like this:
  #
  #   rubyonrails:
  #     id: 1
  #     name: Ruby on Rails
  #     url: http://www.rubyonrails.org
  #
  #   google:
  #     id: 2
  #     name: Google
  #     url: http://www.google.com
  #
  # This fixture file includes two fixtures. Each YAML fixture (ie. record) is given a name and
  # is followed by an indented list of key/value pairs in the "key: value" format. Records are
  # separated by a blank line for your viewing pleasure.
  #
  # Note that fixtures are unordered. If you want ordered fixtures, use the omap YAML type.
  # See http://yaml.org/type/omap.html
  # for the specification. You will need ordered fixtures when you have foreign key constraints
  # on keys in the same table. This is commonly needed for tree structures. Example:
  #
  #    --- !omap
  #    - parent:
  #        id:         1
  #        parent_id:  NULL
  #        title:      Parent
  #    - child:
  #        id:         2
  #        parent_id:  1
  #        title:      Child
  #
  # = Using Fixtures in Test Cases
  #
  # Since fixtures are a testing construct, we use them in our unit and functional tests. There
  # are two ways to use the fixtures, but first let's take a look at a sample unit test:
  #
  #   require 'test_helper'
  #
  #   class WebSiteTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
  #     test "web_site_count" do
  #       assert_equal 2, WebSite.count
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # By default, <tt>test_helper.rb</tt> will load all of your fixtures into your test database,
  # so this test will succeed.
  #
  # The testing environment will automatically load the all fixtures into the database before each
  # test. To ensure consistent data, the environment deletes the fixtures before running the load.
  #
  # In addition to being available in the database, the fixture's data may also be accessed by
  # using a special dynamic method, which has the same name as the model, and accepts the
  # name of the fixture to instantiate:
  #
  #   test "find" do
  #     assert_equal "Ruby on Rails", web_sites(:rubyonrails).name
  #   end
  #
  # Alternatively, you may enable auto-instantiation of the fixture data. For instance, take the
  # following tests:
  #
  #   test "find_alt_method_1" do
  #     assert_equal "Ruby on Rails", @web_sites['rubyonrails']['name']
  #   end
  #
  #   test "find_alt_method_2" do
  #     assert_equal "Ruby on Rails", @rubyonrails.news
  #   end
  #
  # In order to use these methods to access fixtured data within your testcases, you must specify one of the
  # following in your <tt>ActiveSupport::TestCase</tt>-derived class:
  #
  # - to fully enable instantiated fixtures (enable alternate methods #1 and #2 above)
  #     self.use_instantiated_fixtures = true
  #
  # - create only the hash for the fixtures, do not 'find' each instance (enable alternate method #1 only)
  #     self.use_instantiated_fixtures = :no_instances
  #
  # Using either of these alternate methods incurs a performance hit, as the fixtured data must be fully
  # traversed in the database to create the fixture hash and/or instance variables. This is expensive for
  # large sets of fixtured data.
  #
  # = Dynamic fixtures with ERB
  #
  # Some times you don't care about the content of the fixtures as much as you care about the volume.
  # In these cases, you can mix ERB in with your YAML fixtures to create a bunch of fixtures for load
  # testing, like:
  #
  #   <% 1.upto(1000) do |i| %>
  #   fix_<%= i %>:
  #     id: <%= i %>
  #     name: guy_<%= 1 %>
  #   <% end %>
  #
  # This will create 1000 very simple fixtures.
  #
  # Using ERB, you can also inject dynamic values into your fixtures with inserts like
  # <tt><%= Date.today.strftime("%Y-%m-%d") %></tt>.
  # This is however a feature to be used with some caution. The point of fixtures are that they're
  # stable units of predictable sample data. If you feel that you need to inject dynamic values, then
  # perhaps you should reexamine whether your application is properly testable. Hence, dynamic values
  # in fixtures are to be considered a code smell.
  #
  # = Transactional Fixtures
  #
  # Test cases can use begin+rollback to isolate their changes to the database instead of having to
  # delete+insert for every test case.
  #
  #   class FooTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
  #     self.use_transactional_fixtures = true
  #
  #     test "godzilla" do
  #       assert !Foo.all.empty?
  #       Foo.destroy_all
  #       assert Foo.all.empty?
  #     end
  #
  #     test "godzilla aftermath" do
  #       assert !Foo.all.empty?
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # If you preload your test database with all fixture data (probably in the rake task) and use
  # transactional fixtures, then you may omit all fixtures declarations in your test cases since
  # all the data's already there and every case rolls back its changes.
  #
  # In order to use instantiated fixtures with preloaded data, set +self.pre_loaded_fixtures+ to
  # true. This will provide access to fixture data for every table that has been loaded through
  # fixtures (depending on the value of +use_instantiated_fixtures+).
  #
  # When *not* to use transactional fixtures:
  #
  # 1. You're testing whether a transaction works correctly. Nested transactions don't commit until
  #    all parent transactions commit, particularly, the fixtures transaction which is begun in setup
  #    and rolled back in teardown. Thus, you won't be able to verify
  #    the results of your transaction until Active Record supports nested transactions or savepoints (in progress).
  # 2. Your database does not support transactions. Every Active Record database supports transactions except MySQL MyISAM.
  #    Use InnoDB, MaxDB, or NDB instead.
  #
  # = Advanced Fixtures
  #
  # Fixtures that don't specify an ID get some extra features:
  #
  # * Stable, autogenerated IDs
  # * Label references for associations (belongs_to, has_one, has_many)
  # * HABTM associations as inline lists
  # * Autofilled timestamp columns
  # * Fixture label interpolation
  # * Support for YAML defaults
  #
  # == Stable, Autogenerated IDs
  #
  # Here, have a monkey fixture:
  #
  #   george:
  #     id: 1
  #     name: George the Monkey
  #
  #   reginald:
  #     id: 2
  #     name: Reginald the Pirate
  #
  # Each of these fixtures has two unique identifiers: one for the database
  # and one for the humans. Why don't we generate the primary key instead?
  # Hashing each fixture's label yields a consistent ID:
  #
  #   george: # generated id: 503576764
  #     name: George the Monkey
  #
  #   reginald: # generated id: 324201669
  #     name: Reginald the Pirate
  #
  # Active Record looks at the fixture's model class, discovers the correct
  # primary key, and generates it right before inserting the fixture
  # into the database.
  #
  # The generated ID for a given label is constant, so we can discover
  # any fixture's ID without loading anything, as long as we know the label.
  #
  # == Label references for associations (belongs_to, has_one, has_many)
  #
  # Specifying foreign keys in fixtures can be very fragile, not to
  # mention difficult to read. Since Active Record can figure out the ID of
  # any fixture from its label, you can specify FK's by label instead of ID.
  #
  # === belongs_to
  #
  # Let's break out some more monkeys and pirates.
  #
  #   ### in pirates.yml
  #
  #   reginald:
  #     id: 1
  #     name: Reginald the Pirate
  #     monkey_id: 1
  #
  #   ### in monkeys.yml
  #
  #   george:
  #     id: 1
  #     name: George the Monkey
  #     pirate_id: 1
  #
  # Add a few more monkeys and pirates and break this into multiple files,
  # and it gets pretty hard to keep track of what's going on. Let's
  # use labels instead of IDs:
  #
  #   ### in pirates.yml
  #
  #   reginald:
  #     name: Reginald the Pirate
  #     monkey: george
  #
  #   ### in monkeys.yml
  #
  #   george:
  #     name: George the Monkey
  #     pirate: reginald
  #
  # Pow! All is made clear. Active Record reflects on the fixture's model class,
  # finds all the +belongs_to+ associations, and allows you to specify
  # a target *label* for the *association* (monkey: george) rather than
  # a target *id* for the *FK* (<tt>monkey_id: 1</tt>).
  #
  # ==== Polymorphic belongs_to
  #
  # Supporting polymorphic relationships is a little bit more complicated, since
  # Active Record needs to know what type your association is pointing at. Something
  # like this should look familiar:
  #
  #   ### in fruit.rb
  #
  #   belongs_to :eater, :polymorphic => true
  #
  #   ### in fruits.yml
  #
  #   apple:
  #     id: 1
  #     name: apple
  #     eater_id: 1
  #     eater_type: Monkey
  #
  # Can we do better? You bet!
  #
  #   apple:
  #     eater: george (Monkey)
  #
  # Just provide the polymorphic target type and Active Record will take care of the rest.
  #
  # === has_and_belongs_to_many
  #
  # Time to give our monkey some fruit.
  #
  #   ### in monkeys.yml
  #
  #   george:
  #     id: 1
  #     name: George the Monkey
  #
  #   ### in fruits.yml
  #
  #   apple:
  #     id: 1
  #     name: apple
  #
  #   orange:
  #     id: 2
  #     name: orange
  #
  #   grape:
  #     id: 3
  #     name: grape
  #
  #   ### in fruits_monkeys.yml
  #
  #   apple_george:
  #     fruit_id: 1
  #     monkey_id: 1
  #
  #   orange_george:
  #     fruit_id: 2
  #     monkey_id: 1
  #
  #   grape_george:
  #     fruit_id: 3
  #     monkey_id: 1
  #
  # Let's make the HABTM fixture go away.
  #
  #   ### in monkeys.yml
  #
  #   george:
  #     id: 1
  #     name: George the Monkey
  #     fruits: apple, orange, grape
  #
  #   ### in fruits.yml
  #
  #   apple:
  #     name: apple
  #
  #   orange:
  #     name: orange
  #
  #   grape:
  #     name: grape
  #
  # Zap! No more fruits_monkeys.yml file. We've specified the list of fruits
  # on George's fixture, but we could've just as easily specified a list
  # of monkeys on each fruit. As with +belongs_to+, Active Record reflects on
  # the fixture's model class and discovers the +has_and_belongs_to_many+
  # associations.
  #
  # == Autofilled Timestamp Columns
  #
  # If your table/model specifies any of Active Record's
  # standard timestamp columns (+created_at+, +created_on+, +updated_at+, +updated_on+),
  # they will automatically be set to <tt>Time.now</tt>.
  #
  # If you've set specific values, they'll be left alone.
  #
  # == Fixture label interpolation
  #
  # The label of the current fixture is always available as a column value:
  #
  #   geeksomnia:
  #     name: Geeksomnia's Account
  #     subdomain: $LABEL
  #
  # Also, sometimes (like when porting older join table fixtures) you'll need
  # to be able to get a hold of the identifier for a given label. ERB
  # to the rescue:
  #
  #   george_reginald:
  #     monkey_id: <%= ActiveRecord::Fixtures.identify(:reginald) %>
  #     pirate_id: <%= ActiveRecord::Fixtures.identify(:george) %>
  #
  # == Support for YAML defaults
  #
  # You probably already know how to use YAML to set and reuse defaults in
  # your <tt>database.yml</tt> file. You can use the same technique in your fixtures:
  #
  #   DEFAULTS: &DEFAULTS
  #     created_on: <%= 3.weeks.ago.to_s(:db) %>
  #
  #   first:
  #     name: Smurf
  #     *DEFAULTS
  #
  #   second:
  #     name: Fraggle
  #     *DEFAULTS
  #
  # Any fixture labeled "DEFAULTS" is safely ignored.
