## API usage
The API is a closed api. You need a password to get access to the api. You are responsible for
hiding the key in your code.
Who can get API access? Currently the API is only built for associations who want to list their
members on their own website. The association has to make sure, that the member agrees to display
her profile hosted on speakerinnen.org on the association's website.
If you are interested in an API access for your association please send us an email: team@speakerinnen.org
