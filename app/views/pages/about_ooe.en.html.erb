  <h1 class="display-4 py-5">We make female experts visible</h1>

  <p>Podiums are predominantly occupied by men. It is time for women to become
    active in order to change this.</p>

  <p>The online platform ooe.speakerinnen.org offers women who want to contribute
    with their opinion and knowledge on stage at events a platform to become
    more visible. At the same time, this database should help all event organizers
    to find qualified female speakers.</p>

  <p>By collaborating with <a href="https://speakerinnen.org", target='_blank'>speakerinnen.org</a>
    Upper Austrian women are made visible at home and abroad as experts, speakers
    and representatives.</p>

  <p>The project is made possible by <a href="https://www.kompass-ooe.at", target='_blank'>KOMPASS</a>,
    the competence centre for maternity leave and careers on behalf of the
    <a href="https://www.frauenreferat-ooe.at", target='_blank'>Women's Department of the Province of Upper Austria</a>
    and the Women's Advisor of the Provincial Government, Mag.a Christine
    Haberlander, in cooperation with the Upper Austrian Chamber of Commerce.</p>

  <h2 class="display-4 py-5">Set the stage for more female speakers!</h2>

  <p>Far too often we experience that on the stages of events mainly men who are
    invited as experts. "There are no suitable women" and "It is too difficult
    to find female speakers" are often put forward as justifications.  We need a
    balanced gender ratio on stage. If we do not use the knowledge and experience
    of female professionals, we are wasting 50 percent of the available resources
    to us. The male-female ratio among the presenters should be as equal as possible
    in the future because events need to become more diverse.</p>
