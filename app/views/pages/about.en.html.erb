  <h4>Our aim:</h4>
  <p>
    People are often frustrated by the fact that it's usually men who are interviewed by the media or asked to present at conferences and not women.
  </p>
  <p>
    There isn't a biological explanation for this. Men are not cleverer than women. Anyone who points out this discrepancy is usually told that there wasn't a suitable woman* available.
  </p>
  <p>
    We are convinced  that there are a lot more competent women around than just those who speak in public. Girls need female role models, women need the assurance that another view on the topic, ie theirs, is equally relevant.
  </p>
  <p>
    Events need more diversity. The main aim of speakerinnen.org is to increase the visibility of women in the field of public speaking. With the help of our list it will be easier for organisers to find female experts to speak at their events. We also want to actively invite women to speak more often and in public about their area of expertise.

  <h4 class="mt-5">Background:</h4>
  <p>
    Speakerinnen.org was created by 8 women with the support of 4 coaches as part of "Rails Girls Berlin" learning project.
  </p>
  <p>
    The project was initiated by <a href="https://twitter.com/annalist" target="_blank">Anne Roth</a>. The idea of having a database of women speakers originated during numerous discussions both online and offline about the dominance of men in the public domain. There are lots of reasons for this and speakerinnen.org isn't a solution for all of them. But it is a step towards making it easier for organisers to achieve a balanced male to female ratio at their events.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition we want to support women in finding the right platform. We hope they will be encouraged by the experiences of other women and see that they too have a contribution to  make.
  </p>

  <h4 class="mt-5">Railsgirls / Rubymonstas:</h4>
  <p>
    <a href="http://www.railsgirlsberlin.de" target="_blank">Rails Girls</a> is an international non-profit organisation that motivates women to learn computer programming. They facilitate this through interesting workshops, study groups, grants and by creating a positive  learning community. The <a href="https://twitter.com/RubyMonstas" target="_blank">Rubymonsters</a> are a study group which emerged during one of the Rails Girls Berlin workshops.
