    #MASTER SCSS

/* Because inuitcss is broken apart into lots of small, composable modules, it is important that you as the developer piece things together in the correct order. That order is:
*
* Settings: Global variables, site-wide settings, config switches, etc.
* Tools: Site-wide mixins and functions.
* Generic: Low-specificity, far-reaching rulesets (e.g. resets).
* Base: Unclassed HTML elements (e.g. a {}, blockquote {}, address {}).
* Objects: Objects, abstractions, and design patterns (e.g. .media {}).
* Components: Discrete, complete chunks of UI (e.g. .carousel {}). This is the one layer that inuitcss doesn’t get involved with.
* Trumps: High-specificity, very explicit selectors. Overrides and helper classes (e.g. .hidden {}).
