# About speakerinnen.org

speakerinnen.org is a searchable web directory designed specifically for women conference speakers. Women speakers are encouraged to sign up and provide professional information, including their area of expertise, any previous conferences they've presented at, contact details, etc.

The aim of the app is to provide a way for conference and event organizers to find and contact appropriate women speakers. (But obviously there are many different contexts in which it can be used...)

# Getting Started (Initial Setup)

1. Clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:rubymonsters/speakerinnen_liste.git` and access the folder: `cd speakerinnen_liste`. (If you have cloned the repository before and there is still an .env file, delete it.)
2. Copy the file `database.yml.sample` and name it `database.yml` inside the config folder. (The sample-file is a placeholder showing the standard usecase. The file `database.yml` is for individual usage and changes and is ignored by git.)
3. If you don't have Docker Engine installed, please download it [here](https://docs.docker.com/install) for your operating system.
4. Run `make setup` (builds images, installs gems, creates and migrates the database).
5. Run `make seed` (seeds database with example profiles and indexes them in Elasticsearch).

## Local development with Docker (default) -> at the moment this doesn't work on Apple Silicon chips, we are working on a fix.

* `make dev` (opens a development shell, `rake`, `bundle` or `rails` commands will work here)
* `make up` (starts the app directly)
* `make stop` (stops the container)
* `make test` (runs all the tests)
* `make usage` (get a list of possible commands)

### Local development without Docker

In your `database.yml`: make sure `host: db` `username: postgres` and `password: password` are commented out.
You can start a server or run the tests as usual.

## Admin user

If you build or test admin features, you can use the test admin user to test those. The admin user can be found in [db/seeds.rb](db/seeds.rb#L156-L179).

Alternatively, assign the `admin` status to another user via the rails console:

  ```ruby
  # Open a dev shell
  $ make dev

  # Log into the rails console
  $ bundle exec rails c

  # Inside the rails console
  user = Profile.find(<your-profile-id>)
  user.admin = true
  user.save

  # Verify your user admin status
  user.valid?

  # => true
  ```

# Testing

First, open a dev shell by running `make dev`.

```
# Run all tests of the project (same as running `make test`)
$ bundle exec rspec spec

# If the tests are still failing, run:
$ bundle exec rake db:test:clone

# If tests are still failing, run:
$ rails db:test:prepare

# Run tests excluding elasticsearch specs, so without a running elasticsearch server
$  bundle exec rspec spec --tag '~elasticsearch'
```

# Please use Rubocop

```
# Open a dev shell
$ make dev
# Run rubocop and correct all errors it finds
$ rubocop -a
```

#Troubleshooting

## Docker

### Use upgraded Postgres version in Docker
If Postgres got upgraded in the docker-compose file, you need to delete all processes, images
and volumes that still use the older version:
1. Use ```make tear-down``` to delete all processes and images

2. Delete all your local volumes inside Docker as well. (Otherwise you will get a DB connection error)
Check for your speakerinnen volumes in Docker:
``` docker volume ls ```
Ouput will be a list of volumes, pick all the speakerinnen ones (Postgres, Bundle) and delete them (adjust the name if yours is
different):

    ``` docker volume rm speakerinnen_liste_postgres_data ```

    ```docker volume rm speakerinnen_liste_bundle```

3. ```make setup``` to recreate all images, processes and volumes.

4. ```make seed``` to populate the volumes.

# Export emails:

connect to heroku and the console
use the rake task: profiles_to_csv
then the firstname, lastname and email address of all published and not exported profiles is outputed
copy and past in numbers

it also set the exported_at field to the current date
