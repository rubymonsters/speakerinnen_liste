speakerinnen.org is a searchable web directory designed specifically for female conference speakers. Female speakers are encouraged to sign up and provide professional information, including their area of expertise, any previous conferences they've presented at, contact details, etc.

The aim of the app is to provide a way for conference and event organizers to find and contact appropriate female speakers. (But obviously there are many different contexts in which it can be used...)
